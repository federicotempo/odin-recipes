    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>
        Onion soup is a classic and comforting dish with roots in French cuisine, 
        renowned for its rich flavors and simple preparation. This soup begins with 
        the slow caramelization of thinly sliced onions, which transforms their natural 
        sweetness into a deep, savory base. Simmered in a flavorful broth, the tender onions 
        create a robust soup that warms both body and soul.
